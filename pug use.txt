BOILER PLATE WITH INDENTATION

| text = to show text use pipe
.class
#id
#[a(href="/") Home ] for <a href="/">Home</a>


//
we will be using template inheritance of pug
means what should be same basic layout 

for that we will be having base.pug/home.pug/contact.pug like files

now home.pug/contact.pug like files will extend the base.pug means whatever written in that we will layout is written we fill that

now each and every block, style, script will be replaced

INDENTATION IS SUPER IMPORTANT

what is mongodb?
NoSQL database
document oriented open source, written in cpp

document oriented - store in the form of document
data store in the form of BSON (Binary Javascript Object Notation)

while in the rdbms
tables - collections(mongodb)
rows - documents(mongodb)

what is mongoD - host process - it is primary daemon so When you install and run MongoDB on your system, you typically start the mongod process first, which listens for incoming connections from MongoDB client applications and responds to their queries and commands.

what is mongo - specific commond line shell that connects to specific instance of mongod.

even if mongo is not their then we can use python, nodejs to connect to mongod 

By default, MongoDB starts at port 27017


we will use ubuntu to run the server
now installed mongodb comminity version and then in c drive 
make folder of data the db
now move to C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\6.0\bin (copy this from that)
advance system varabl > environment > path click > new > paste



but for using all this use mongd in admin_shell and  mongoose in mongoose shell.

MONGODB - commands

CRUD OPERATIONS

0. show dbs // to see all dbs's

1. use mykart (now db will point to db)

CREATING
2. db.items.insertOne({
    name:"Samsung",
    price:1233,
    rating:4,
    qty:12,
    sold:2
}) (now this document will be added in database)

3. db.items.insertMany(
    [
{
    name:"iphone",
    price:123213123,
    rating:5,
    qty:1212,
    sold:212
},
{
    name:"realme",
    price:11233,
    rating:3,
    qty:112,
    sold:12
}
    ]
) // now the we can add multiple items at a time


READING
4. db.items.find() // now data will be shown even on closing the mongo in shell even 

db.items.find(filterObject)

here is no restriction for schema means in one of the object above we could add other one more as "isBig: true" then it will be shown in only one

5. db.items.find({rating:3.5})
getting items based on condition 

6. getting rating greater than and equal 3.5
db.items.find({rating:{$gte :3.5}})


7. USING AND OPERATOR
db.items.find({rating:{$lt :3.5}, price:{$gt:4000}}) // rating > 3.5 AND price > 4000

8. using OR

db.items.find(
    {
        $or:
        [
            {rating:{$lt:3.5}}, 
            {price:{$gt:1232}}
        ]
    }
)

DELETING

9. to get some filed  to show only
db.items.find( { status: "A" } )

The operation corresponds to the following SQL statement:

SELECT * from inventory WHERE status = "A"


10. deleting items from mongodb
db.items.deleteOne({price:2200}) // will delete first entry check using db.items.find({price:2200})

11. db.items.deleteMany({price:2200}) // all delete

12.     CREATING COLLECTIONS

can create another collection By
show collections // all collections
use items // using items now
db.anotherCollection.insertOne({a:212}) // now one more collection will be created

13. UPDATING ONE ITEM
db.items.updateOne(selection, newValue)

db.items.updateOne({name:"Moto"}, {$set:{price:2}})

13. UPDATING MANY items

db.items.updateMany({name:"Moto"}, {$set:{price:212}})



USING MONGODB COMPASS WE CAN DO CRUD OPERATIONS IN GUI MANNER. (replacing mongo)
BUT FOR THIS "mongd" should be running in admin_shell as that is the server (local)

now for mongo have data folder then db inside it of local C


as we are using mongodb and nodejs(express/pug) at different platform 
so now for connecting this we would be install mongoose whihc will make the layer bet 
mongodb and nodejs.
